It is the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes released the year before and a prequel to the original Metal Gear. The game has a complex story with long cut-scene sequences but there are fewer and they are shorter compared to earlier Metal Gear Solid titles. Most of the gameplay mechanics introduced in Ground Zeroes are carried over: it is still an action game and stealth oriented but replaces the linear corridor design from most earlier titles with large open world environments that offer the player unrestricted freedom for the approach. The world has now a real-time day and night cycle and various weather effects that influence enemy behaviour visibility and sound.

135,sonic the hedgehog,1991-06-23,'sonic team' 'sega',3.1,1.1K,1100.0,'platform',"Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D side-scrolling platformer whose gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs slopes high falls and loop-the-loops. The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (""badniks"" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes falling into bottomless pits being crushed by moving walls or platforms and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.
             

              Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy he will survive. However all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection certain hazards (such as drowning being crushed falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.
             

              The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill Marble Spring Yard Labyrinth Star Light and Scrap Brain) each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.
             

              At the end of each zone's third act the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more) which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives if they have any continues).
             

              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a ""Secret Zone"" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a ""goal block"" (which ends the level).","'recomendado pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega. no lo tenian todo atado' 'the one that started it all! and what a way to kick things off. a household gem of the sega systems and the source of many childhood memories for me.'

'here’s a pressing question for all you gamers under the age of thirty: do you actively avoid playing games from the pre-3d era because of their lack of availability or because their foundation is comparatively primitive and therefore jarringly inaccessible? the reason can’t be because these games are locked in an archival vault for they are commonly ported to modern platforms. it must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date. c’mon fess up. i’m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections but there seems to be a widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception especially those of the early pixelated 2d period released before the late 1990s. a sneering distaste for the classics isn’t as pervasive with films or music. zoomers will attend theater screenings of 2001: a space odyssey high as a kite and emphatically detail their “transcendental experience” to their peers with a pulp fiction poster in the background of their dorm rooms. no one is delusional enough to place the prequels or disney star wars films over the immortal original trilogy regardless of their age. maybe it’s because i spend too much time on the internet but i’ve noticed that discovering older music artists via the world wide web is a more common practice among teenagers now than it was when i was in high school. older video games on the other hand are treated with the same reaction of revulsion as if they were being forced to eat their brussels sprouts. admittedly as someone born in the early 3d era many of the industry practices and comparatively primitive facets of game design can verge on being excruciating. i can count merely a handful of games that were released before i was born that are among my personal favorites as there is only so much pain i can handle before my spirit shatters and i am in dire need of a relaxing bath with some chocolate ice cream for comfort. conversely there are plenty of those whose gaming prime was this jagged era and the shift to 3d left them bewildered. they’ve assigned themselves to the role of gaming elder statesmen whose repertoire is cryogenically frozen to the time before the medium became polygonal. after a certain point where the gaming industry reached a point of proficiency with 3d visuals to an almost cinematic extent games that resembled those of the primeval pixelated years started popping out of the indie woodwork. one of the first breakout titles in this new wave of old-school revival games was shovel knight a 2d side scroller that arguably bridged the generational gap of gamers.'",8500.0,135.0,1900.0,1200.0

Interactive Entertainment which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium.
             

              The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge slaughter and mystery set entirely in Mordor the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion an ordinary man who loses everything including his mortal life.
             

              The game is set in a fully open world and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor.
             

              The melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier.
             

              A unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name rank and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.","'it has combat from arkham and assassins creed climbing from uncharted stealth from every 7th gen third person game you spend half of the time clearing out bandit camps and you play the most ai generated character in all of gaming. i’m sure we all remember that iconic lord of the rings characters name. this is a game so derivative of every other game around it that it lacks any identity and purpose to exist.'

'they really took the best kirby game and made it even better. everything that made the original game great is enhanced here in addition to this game having several brand new modes after milky way wishes. this game is the origin of a lot of modern kirby mainstays like masked dedede and galacta knight. clearing the true arena in this game was a massive accomplishment for anyone in my friend group who could survive the final 4 gauntlet. lots of good memories with this game both playing it back then and going back to it now. truly the pinnacle of the series.'",5800.0,47.0,773.0,427.0

Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King.
             

              Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses cities and environs the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first the prince can only pick up smaller items but as the Katamari grows the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels the Katamari can eventually pick up people cars and other bigger items.
             

              Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.
             

              The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince. Two players can also battle head-to-head in a Katamari competition.","'voz de peter griffin en español dios mio este juego me ha cambiado la vida' ""heard they're making video games be good now"" ""katamari damacy ia just pure fun. once you learn the controls it's literally picking up objects. as you increase in size so do your pickups. racing against a time-limit is somehow relaxing just sucking up the world with ease.""

The gameplay is still largely identical as Dante engages many opponents with a fast fighting style stringing together combos and hits in quick succession.,"'dmc devil may cry é um jogo bem sólido com uma das melhores gameplays da série e as melhores e mais divertidas seções de plataforma. a gameplay é muito boa com muitos combos fluidos e variedade da armas  como parte fundamental dessa estrutura a troca rápida de armas durante um combo. porém mesmo sendo um game muito gostoso de jogar  os inimigos não acompanham essa fluidez toda e acabam sendo na esmagadora maioria do jogo apenas sacos de pancadas de combos o que abaixa e muito a dificuldade do game o que pode desagradar alguns ( incluindo eu). no geral embora conte com um ou outro inimigo interessante no geral os inimigos não tem metade do carisma da série principal o que tbm se reflete um pouco nos poucos chefes do game na qual  dois em especial são bem criativos e legais  porém os outros não tem o mesmo tempero que a série clássica. quanto a história aoesar de um reboot dá pra perceber o cuidado de contar uma história de início mais consistente e uniforme diferente da série principal que é uma bagunça tremenda na questão do enredo e cronologia. a história do jogo funciona passando um ar demoníaco mais sujo e pé no chão do que o padrão anime da série original o que nesse jogo caiu muito bem. porém acredito que o maior responsável pelo rage que esse jogo sofreu seja seu protagonista dante que não tem 20% do carisma do protagonista original e somada a péssima estratégia de marketing usada na promoção desse jogo na época apenas reforçaram a aversão ao personagem o que infelizmente se refletiu na repercussão do game. porém infelizmente fico curioso pra saber quais seriam os rumos da história a partir desse game os quais eram promissores.\n                     \n                     no geral se você gosta do gênero hack n slash e deseja uma experiência extremamente gostosa de jogar você vai gostar de dmc devil may cry.'

'action games generally operate on the concept of player empowerment granting the tools to overcome any challenge without a scratch as long as players have the skill to realize that potential. meanwhile horror games operate on the concept of player\n                     \n                      disempowerment\n                     \n                      giving the bare minimum in order to foster a tense atmosphere so balancing the priorities of each genre seems like mixing oil and water. resident evil games are famous for trying to do so but they usually break into a horror-centric first half and an action-centric back half without a true blending of the concepts. the evil within meanwhile actually managed it but had to alienate players in some key ways in order to do so. firstly the logic behind the story is nearly impossible to follow at first leaving players unable to find their footing confused at why the progression is so jumpy and unfocused. then the mechanical restrictions feel like they’re equally arbitrary: sebastian can only initially carry about twelve bullets and not even a full healthbar’s worth of recovery. he can barely run at all and in order to alleviate any of this you may have to bank up green gel over the course of multiple chapters. it can seem like the game is simply trying to make action feel scary by stressing out players with cheap deaths but once you commit to learning the game a brilliant method behind the madness reveals itself. while the story\n                     \n                      is\n                     \n                     mostly nonsense the abstract nature of it allows for level design suited to a wide variety of challenges. with new mechanics being introduced at a steady pace players are constantly kept on the backfoot and thus disempowered even as their growing mechanical knowledge empowers them. the shallow capacity for supplies is an obvious form of disempowerment which prompts players to spend resources cleverly but their abundance between each fight empowers players to use their entire toolkit freely. the upgrade system empowers; the below-par baselines make unupgraded stats more of a problem in the face of scaling challenge. for every give there’s a take and thus a harmony between action and horror is reached. as stated before though the “take” for that brilliance is a frontloaded sense of disempowerment with players having to get through most of the game before they’ve experienced enough character growth and skill development to redress the balance. so i really can’t blame anyone for bouncing off of this game but i also truly believe that as of today (less than a week away from re4 remake) it’s the best merging of action and horror in gaming. resident evil 4 is pure satisfying action dead space commits to bloody horror but the evil within is purely… both.'

Fan-favorite character Chloe Frazer must enlist the aid of renowned mercenary Nadine Ross from Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End in order to recover a fabled ancient Indian artifact and keep it out of the hands of a ruthless war profiteer. Together they’ll venture deep into the mountains of India in search of the legendary artifact. Along the way they’ll learn to work together to unearth the mystery of the artifact fight their way through fierce opposition and prevent the region from falling into chaos.,"""i was worried that the retirement of nathan would leave uncharted without anything to carry a story as i never considered chloe a very interesting character in 2. thankfully lost legacy compensates nicely with a shorter story that doesn't ask too much of the player while still hitting all the correct beats. the gameplay improvements made in 4 make a triumphant return though the climbing is still annoying. each big set-piece is dynamic and exciting the game never lingers too long or moves on too quickly. on the open-zone section in the beginning i have conflicted feelings. on one hand the dialouge between chloe and nadine is charming and entertaining without feeling too artificial and i enjoyed the scenery. however this series has always been about maintaining momentum. i now have a newfound appreciation for the sublime pacing of the older games after experiencing what it feels like to lose that forward-moving feeling. the game definietly picks up the tempo again afterwards but i can't say the section left a good impression overall. the rest of the game is exactly as one would expect. the villain is nothing special the platforming is cool and rhytmic but not very complex and there aren't really any themes to delve into beyond the absolute minimum stuff. i don't mind though i am satisfied with the game being a nice adventure to relax with a role it easily fulfills."" 'the final uncharted game (for now atleast) and its....fine.' 'bom' 'a dlc do melhor jogo já feito logo a melhor dlc já feita.' 'fun game but generic as generic can possibly be. amy hennig as a writer was the soul of this franchise and without her uncharted became stale. neil druckmann gives you a  modest american movie but as a videogame he gives the most generic story possible and fails to write chloe as a charismatic protagonist - he transformed her in another nathan drake -. every action scene is copied from another uncharted game and the structure add nothing to mechanics and functionality. the villain is bland and the male characters are there to fill the misandry quota. all the merits of this game still belongs to uncharted 12 and 3. play only if you want a little movie experience or watch the cutscenes on youtube.' 'everyone told me that uncharted was a videogame franchise with no bad games well what do you call this garbage then?  the story is that chloe hires nadine (from the fourth game) to help her retrieve a ancient indian artifact this is an odd idea for a story because chloe knows about nadine\'s history with her friends nathan and sam drake yet she works with someone who hates them and doesn\'t think she will turn on her and when she finds out that sam was helping out nadine feels betrayed assaults chloe and abandons her until she apologizes but nadine says that she is now only helping chloe out for the treasure but don\'t worry she gets over it randomly after they help a trapped elephant it happens so fast that there isn\'t even a moment where nadine is completely over it she randomly is and they both act like it never happened because the writing is terrible when it comes to the character moments and after they are trapped with sam him and nadine both argue a lot because of their history but when interacting chloe trusts the girl who assaulted her and tried to kill her former lover and his brother more than she trusts her former lover\'s brother which feels like feminism where the two girls get along where as the man is played for a foil to it which is frowned upon in this and since nadine never shows any remorse for what she did in the last game to the protagonist and sam does it makes nadine even less likeable than she already was and ruins the story completely and studios need to stop this garbage.  the characters are no where near as good as their last previous appearances thanks to chloe being sympathetic to a former villain over a man nadine worsened by trying to make us like her by being an unlikeable villain to hero tale without even regretting her actions and made sam to feel more of a nuisance than a main character to the point where he doesn\'t even bring his own grapple hook (even though he would never do that) stop writing feminism over male\'s feelings in games and shame the people who think otherwise the villain is barely anymore interesting than the first game\'s main villain with his history with an old kingdom but it doesn\'t go beyond that and i enjoyed the traits of the second game\'s main villain more.  the graphics are as good as the remastered versions of the first 3 games with some moments are awe (the best being when you run off a train heading off a broken bridge even if the second game\'s train scene was much better) but no where near as good as the fourth game and not as many memorable moments to be on par with games 2 and 3 they have better looking events than the first game though.  the gameplay is the same as before only shorter to the point where it\'s less than half the length of games 2 3 and 4 and in chapter 4 you can optionally find coins to retrieve a ruby bracelet but no other moments like it make it feel random silenced pistols were a great addition but chapters 5 and especially 4 feel far too long and could have been shortened to make 2 more chapters especially with how big you have to travel for completing chapter 4 is.  the music is not as memorable as before due to less moments to have them takeover the scene for atmosphere and the song at the end ""borders by m.i.a"" is a bland and forgettable song.  uncharted: the lost legacy brought back the uncharted franchise to consoles and made me wish that it had stayed lost.'",4700.0,51.0,1300.0,754.0

'obrigado capcom por essa masterpiece' ""man like i wanted to like this just as much as 1 and 2 but there are a crapton of bad level design and enemy placement choices making this ultimately the most inferior out of the classic trilogy. levels are cramped and theres a lot of times where you will get ambush sniped by an offscreen zombie hiding behind a corner or just zombies in one-person-wide corridors where you better hope you have the ammo to take them out otherwise you aren't getting through. nemesis is cool though i like the funny zombie guy. i wish he showed up more frequently and stalked you all throughout the map but the times he does show up can be exciting and the man runs at you like a football player which is awesome. all in all the game is definitely memorable and worth checking out if you like resident evil stuff but it is definitely the most flawed and occasionally frustrating game of the classic style so beware.""

The player controls Pac-Man through a maze eating pac-dots (also called pellets or just dots). When all pac-dots are eaten Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Four enemies (Blinky Pinky Inky and Clyde) roam the maze trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost the game ends. Near the corners of the maze are four larger flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next generally becoming shorter as the game progresses.,"'pacman is such a fucking idiot jesus christ. who decided to make this stupid yellow fucking circle the protagonist of a game. he never even listens to simple goddamn instructions he would rather die than fuction according to his intended fucking purpose. there’s a reason he’s piss colored he’s a fucking giant piss-ball that everyone should hate. fuck you pac-man' ""one of the all time classics and with good reason. it's pac-man do i really need to explain what this game is? eat dot get chased by ghost big dot means you can eat ghost. the concept is addicting but i believe the true reason why this game popped off hard was due to its character. no longer were you shooting aliens in a generic spaceship you were a character with a name getting chased by other characters with names and even their own personalities. i don't know if this was the first game ever to do such a thing (probably not) but it was the first to do it and really explode in popularity. the power dynamic flipping whenever you get a power pellet is also a pretty cartoony mechanic in its own right which makes the game just have this cartoonish charm. there's also very basic cutscenes every couple of levels that give a decent break in the action. pac man is cool one of the most classic arcade games of all time.""

It was released on November 21 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.
             

              The Sands of Time developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999 but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline winning the game several awards.
             

              The game was developed for the PC PlayStation 2 GameCube Xbox and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004) Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005) and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010).

The gameplay consists of two primary modes: Mission and Mother Base. Mission are the actual action sequences of the game where the player must infiltrate an enemy territory or fight a boss whereas Mother Base is an army management.

'peace walker is by all accounts a worthy canonical chapter in the saga with its own dignity in terms of the themes covered and consideration for the in-depth development of the characters. on the gameplay experience aspects it is also a pretty good transposition of the mechanics from previous games to a handheld console especially considering the major limitations of the psp: clearly affected by this are mainly the ai of the enemies the complexity of the environments and a certain overall fluidity of the experience which can initially seem quite clunky. good choices were therefore to model the gameplay in a relatively short mission structure to increase action sequences over stealth phases and to be inspired by the type of games proposed by the highly successful titles on psp such as monster hunter freedom unite. the result is a very fun game with various customization options and a very high level of replayability with an almost arcade-like flavor in improving your gaming execution that may annoy those who rightly believe that such a title deserved more attention but which in the end considering the finished product turns out to be decidedly remarkable.'

645,tekken 3,1997-03-22,'namco' 'namco hometek',3.9,564,564.0,'fighting',"Tekken 3 maintains the same core fighting system and concept as its predecessors but brings many improvements such as significantly more detailed graphics and animations fifteen new characters added to the game's roster more modern music and faster and more fluid gameplay.
              
              Perhaps the most noticeable change from Tekken 2 fight system is movement reform - whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous Tekken games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers) Tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction. Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games) but keeping leaps to reasonable realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable and put more use to sidestep dodges as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs more escapes from tackles and stuns better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters allowing them to connect in combo-situations where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws.
             

              Tekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up minigame called ""Tekken Force"" which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3. There is also a minigame ""Tekken Ball"" similar to beach volleyball where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attack to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent's area thus causing damage.","'deserves the praises that it gets. revolutionized the 3d fighting game genre and is basically the street fighter 2 for 3d fighters.' ""you'd think that after tekken 2 set the bar so high that there would be nowhere to go but down from here but they just kept making the game even better. we have an entirely new fresh set of characters here the gameplay has been polished to a fine sheen and theres a ton of bonus modes you can play that inadvertently give you practice for the main fighting mode which is awesome since the normal training mode labbing can sometimes not be everyones cup of tea. the other gamemodes also give lonely fighters like myself much more to do than just playing arcade mode and getting clapped by dumb ai enemies over and over. this is pretty much the golden standard of tekken and there's a reason why this game is rated so highly not just among tekken games but even among fighting game titles and overall ps1 games."" 'the first\n                     \n                      truly\n                     \n                     3d fighting game you can get some really spectacular fights especially if you know what you\'re doing (which i don\'t). unfortunately the spectacle is reserved for a fraction of the characters. a quarter of the roster is complete dogshit and another quarter is just kinda ""meh"". playing a character as bland as nina after flipping and kicking around with eddy is just too jarring.'

The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks AP and EP gauges etc.) but random encounters are eliminated. Instead the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's ""boost"" gauge to cut in and act next although enemies can boost as well and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts.

""so to start off...my first thought about this game when i saw it was it was a sequel to the valkyrie profile series. that's not quite what this is but i'll explain what i mean below."" 'game looks kinda nice i guess.  takes the valkyrie game series name and uses it as toilet paper though.' 'as my first time playing a valkyrie game it fell a little flat. combat is actually really fun and is ultimately what kept me playing. the story is a bit bare but the companions you pick up along the way have a charm of their own. the environments are beautiful but a little bland although this is a game about a world already in ruin. this music is pretty cool and i enjoyed the multiple endings. ultimately i had fun.' 'i think the most interesting thing about valkyrie elysium is that it’s not a story about saving the world. it’s about what happens in that period where everything is ending already. most of my time playing this game was spent in ruins fighting the vengeful spirits that still roam the land alongside those spirits who chose to fight with me and listening to the voices that had long perished. and although odin tells you from the beginning that your efforts are done so save it actually walking through valkyrie elysiums world the question haunted me: what is there left so save? this question is at the heart of the game. spoilers follow the valkyrie a hollow shell at the beginning distanced from the world she wants to save becomes more and more involved over the course of the story – through the help of the spirits that chose to stay with her. and in the end the player must choose what to do with that involvement. the different endings all give a different answer to the questions “what is there left to save? what is there left to fight for?”. the so-called “true ending” has a somewhat cynical answer to this: that the gods who were responsible for the worlds’ demise will not see the next one. another ending plainly states: heterosexual love. in every ending the world we walked through in the game ends. the agency of the player is to decide what happens next.' 'this feels like a low budget ps2 game and i mean that as a compliment. it has a fun battle system and it looks nice. the rest of the game however is for lack of a better term fucking boring. the story is generic the stage design is bland and while i do like a few characters they are also generic.'",218.0,32.0,343.0,527.0

From a house in the city journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess. In each world you have a different power to affect the way time behaves and it is time's strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time behaviors include: the ability to rewind objects that are immune to being rewound time that is tied to space parallel realities time dilation and perhaps more.

""genealogy of the holy war\n                     \n                     is almost less of a game and more like a story that you interact with. if it wasn’t for the near unrivaled mix of worldbuilding

fire emblem as a franchise going forward it’s also the most unique entry in the series by far. even with all of its influence and acclaim not one game past this has ever tried replicating everything this game did. some of that could be attributed to the new systems being seen more as flaws rather than benefits or the sheer complexity maybe too scary for newer players. i’m not sure.\n                     \n                     i finished this game over a week ago and i’ve been banging my head on the wall trying to figure out what to say. i feel like i need to get the word out of what this game is but it’s just not fully coming to me. i’d love to write a review as long as a single enemy phase in this game but i really can’t do that as much as i try. so i’ll suffice by writing something shorter while explaining why you should at least experience this game once.\n                     \n                     war. legacy. succession. betrayal. tragedy. these are all themes that\n

    \n                      genealogy\n                     \n                      out of all the games i’ve experienced delves the most into the pure tragedy and unfairness of what war is. there are so many moments where you just.. can’t save everyone. the other games have similar moments but this one melds it into the gameplay so perfectly and precisely. every map is vast with history communities and density. they genuinely do feel like actual locales rather than “a video game level”. that goes both to its benefit and detriment from a gameplay perspective but from a\n                     \n                      story\n                     \n                     perspective it’s pure bliss. we follow our heroes through lush forests sprawling plains harsh mountains scorching deserts etc. you slowly proceed through this seemingly endless war each map becoming more and more hopeless.\n                     \n                     i should also preface that you need to experience this story blind. i know it’s very hard to do as such with how much the middle plot twist is spoiled to everyone but i encourage you to stay as blind as possible.\n                     \n                      genealogy’s\n                     \n                     narrative is fantastic not only for a fire emblem game but for a piece of media in general. seliph is one of my favorite video game characters of all time because of how we follow his journey from suffering a harsh young life but growing to become a fine young man himself capable of what his mission is. once again i’m not going to elaborate so the reader can find out what happens themselves but the story is no exaggeration simply masterful.\n                     \n                     generational storytelling is one of my favorite tropes of all time. seeing how descendants of a generation will remedy the mistakes regrets or failures of their predecessors has always been so engaging to me. while\n                     \n                      genealogy's\n                     \n                     latter half isn't nearly as narratively complex as the former half it's story about the next generation of heroes is among one of my favorites for this trope. ily seliph.\n                     \n                     presentation also goes a long way of course. every music track in the game adds to the atmosphere so heavily it’s easily one of the best soundtracks i’ve heard on the super famicom. some tracks were so masterfully composed i nearly shed tears i couldn’t believe how well it played me especially when i can rarely cry at soundtracks anymore. the graphics can be hit or miss especially with the character portraits but the maps and environments are top notch. i could really look at them for so long.\n                     \n                     i think that’s pretty much all i could think of to say about\n                     \n                      genealogy of the holy war\n                     \n                     . as a game… it’s a mess. possibly even objectively bad. but as a story a piece of artistry… it’s an undeniable masterpiece. it’s certainly not for everyone i’m aware but it is worth experiencing in full at least once. not my favorite fire emblem because of the gameplay but definitely the best narrative and cast of characters in my eyes.\n                     \n                     also ever notice how so many of the people who say this game sucks (or other classic fe games for that matter) are three houses fans or have three houses pfps? curious …."" ""a great game and my favorite of the fire emblem franchise. the game is kind of easy for a fire emblem game and it's clearly not the best tactical experience you'll get in this franchie. this game is more a playable story than it is a game with a good story in it. every element of genealogy serves the narrative the strenght of the characters reflects their developpement and their place in the world the challenges are constantly evolving to flow with the story story events that you can't even participate in take place during fights... this allow the universe to feel real and we can feel the stakes of what's happening. it's clearly not a game for everyone it can be slow and tedious at times and the story can be less interesting in the second half but if you think a game using his mecanics mainly to tell a compelling plot with memorable characters may be for you i'll blindy recommand that you at least give it a try. don't be afraid of the difficulty if you're not used to play old fire emblem games you can save litteraly every turn and you have broken characters among your units.""",1300.0,81.0,836.0,385.0

'oh my god. i can’t believe i slept on this game/ kept it for last thinking it would be too hard for me. despite being on the snes it’s an absolute masterpiece of a game which can be attributed to the fact it tests the snes to its limits being the final snes game ever made released in 1999 nine years after the snes’s inception and 3 years into the n64’s lifespan. shouzou kaga was evidently opposed to making a fire emblem game on the n64 believing the 3d graphics would hurt the appearance of his characters and that philosophy to keep the characters 2d carried over to the ps1’s tear ring saga: yutona heroes war chronicles. that too went well but let’s focus on fe5.' 'this game probably took about 10 years from my lifespan but i still loved it the infamous difficulty of the game is actually really satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half but after chapter 18 or so is.... painful to say the least. still after strategizing for hours constantly saving and loading states and rage momentssense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old srpg is remarkable\n                     \n                     probably my favorite aspect about fe5 is the overall tone of it. while fe4 had it\'s fair share of dark moments this game is straight up depressing you actually feel how bleak and despair the situation is in every chapter. by the beggining of the game you feel completely lostand confused by the mechanics and the difficulty just like leif feeling lost on this brutal war. you are not a group of experienced and heroic knights leading for victory you are mostly common folk going against a full fledged empire and you\'re obviously going to get obliterated against such force. but as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units a hope slowly rises and you go from ""how the hell am i going to survive from this?"" to ""hey i can actually do this!"" and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps. and then you are facing with the strongest forces of the empire. it\'s actually even harder then before but you have so much more experince with the gameyou don\'t feel as powerless as before. and after you\'ve gone through so much beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to you\n                     \n                     this is phenomenal storytelling and you can only have this in a videogame that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay. that\'s why remake of this game is probably going to suck since they\'ll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty.\n                     \n                     gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management and i love this you can capture enemies to steal their equipmentbut it\'s significantly harder and risky to dosince you\'ll deal much less and take much more damage. but since you don\'t get much chance to buy and repair weapons you really have to pay attention the resources you have and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you face\n                     \n                     fatigue is also a new mechanic which if you use a unit too much you won\'t be able to use them in the next chapter which makes powerful units more tricky to use adding another depth to the gameplay. you\'ll only want to use them when necessary so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units i gotta say this was hard to get used to especially after i obliterated every enemy with ayra and larcei in fe4 but it didn\'t took long to for me to actually like it\n                     \n                     also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly. fe5 abandons the massive maps of fe4 in favor of smaller but focused maps with multiple objectives and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my skin(those goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares) for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives. you have defense escape fog of war(which isn\'t that bad in my opinion) and of course normal seize missions. also each map has it\'s own unique objective which makes every single map even more memorable. varied objectives makes each chapter fresh which is something i\'ve never seen in an srpg\n                     \n                     weakest part of this game imo are the characters in fe4 you have a lot of optional conversations between characters and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit in fe5 most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them.\n                     \n                     but i really like how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolled\n                     \n                     though this doesn\'t mean that this game has no good character writing far from it leif is one the best written main character\'s i\'ve ever seen in a game. like i mentioned before you start of the game as powerless and with zero knowledge on the complex mechanics of the game. just like leif who\'s a 15 year old who has never commanded an army. this is obviously no coincidence leif represents the player but unlike most games that have a main character which is""representing the player""leif isn\'t a silent protagonist his development from an inexperienced kid to a mature war commander is very natural and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player as you understand how the game works and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways. leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writing\n                     \n                     i\'m not sure if fire emblem 5 is better than 4but still this is one the finest srpg\'s ever made. it\'s frusturating for sure but it\'s so well designed in nearly every aspect it\'s impossible for me to hate it. i\'d highly recommend it if you liked fe4 and simply want to see more from this world.'",820.0,65.0,771.0,329.0

""neat game. controls were a bit interesting to get used to but the game is built around them so there wasn't really much of a problem. i do wish the fov was a bit bigger and you could see where you are landing when you have to do platforming though. this game does a good job in putting the metroid formula in 3d but because it is now in 3d theres a lot more nooks and crannies that things are hidden in so you have to definitely have your eyes more peeled than the 2d metroids. the map system is also more difficult to understand than the 2d metroids. i didn't even really have a problem with the mandatory mcguffin hunt at the end or the constant backtracking since those are kind of staples of the metroid series and serve to give you more opportunities to find secrets by constantly returning to places you have been before. putting a fast travel option would completely defeat the purpose imo. at the end of the day this game didn't blow me away like it did for so many other people but i can still see a decent game when i play one and this is definitely that.""

Sora can equip up to three Keyblades at a time and cycle between them to use his abilities. Another addition is the Attractions mechanic which occasionally allows Sora to summon and pilot a vehicle inspired by Disney theme park attractions.

It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support but in August 2014 the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive.
             

              Until Dawn is designed to be played multiple times as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the ""Butterfly Effect"" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview it has been said that Until Dawn has ""hundreds of endings"". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.
             

              The gameplay is focused on exploration quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.
             

              Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release with praise directed at the visuals choice mechanic horror elements music voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story mostly the second half camera angles character movements and partially linear plot.","'sam❤️\u200d🩹' ""i don't like this game. ive seen it all the way through like 4 times"" 'camp' ""(played before 2023)\n                     \n                     probably the game with the best choices in this narrative-driven style game where the choices do matter even if they don't create much branching paths. the coolest part about this game is that depending on your choices everyone can survive or everyone can die and you don't really get that in many other games. i think it also had an okay story feeling very stereotypical to make it easy for them to create characters. voice acting and performances are okay but there is nothing interesting about the gameplay. qte's being essentially the only aspect of these type of games is fine but they aren't really done in interesting ways and there isn't much else outside of this. the areas you are walking around aren't super interactable in heavy rain and they aren't well-paced to explore like in twd.""

""when i played the ps3 version of the game as my first experience with the hd version of sonic unleashed it was kinda frustrating. the medal hunting kills the pacing of the game if you are just trying to go through the levels yet the game doesn't really make an effort to tell you to slow down and find all the medals since the quotas are usually manageable on their own before they get spiked for no reason at the very end. the levels are fun as hell though i don't even really have a problem with the werehog outside of maybe a few werehog levels overstaying their welcome. the game just has a fun vibe to it i like it. the framerate on the ps3 version also sucks play the xbox version instead preferrably on series x where it runs at 60 fps and is incredible. if you play this just make sure to collect lots of medals and do as much stuff as you can so the game won't just cockblock you from finishing it near the end."" ""sonic unleashed isn't a terrible game but there are enough gripes i had with it that made the game a slog to beat. the werehog levels while sometimes enjoyable overstayed their welcome and the combat isn't all that great. the sun & moon coins were also a pain in the ass to collect for a good chunk of the game and will probably take up a good majority of your playthrough. it gets a bit easier to get the amount required to complete the game once you unlock the extra acts but unless you really pay attention as you play the levels you're going to find yourself replaying them quite a bit if you want to make progress. eggmanland is one of the most infuriating levels i have played for quite some time. not only does it have an absurdly big difficulty curve from every other level but the level drags on longer than the other werehog levels. considering my lack of skill at sonic games i'm honestly surprised i managed to beat it let alone without having to grind for extra lives. even with that in mind it still took me over an hour to do it.""

""they tried to 1-up yakuza 4 in terms of the stuff it offers. more characters more minigames more places just more more more more more. it is impressive how much content they managed to pack into this game and while that is definitely a strength of this game it also comes to the games detriment at times imo. mostly in due to the fact that the game is longer than the other yakuza games and the story kinda lags behind because of it. each character basically has their own unrelated story that ends in a cliffhanger that is resolved in the final chapter and i don't really think said cliffhanger was worth all the buildup...? idk man if you've played the series enough to make it this far you already know what you are getting yourself in for and if you for some reason want to start with this there's enough content to warrant it still being interesting i guess. the final boss also sucked and that always leaves bad aftertastes in my gamer mouth. all in all i can see what this game was going for and it wasn't bad per se but i didn't like it personally."" ""this game is sort of a reverse of yakuza 4. cause while i thought the story of 4 was incredible i thought the gameplay could be a better. this game is the opposite. the 5 characters are actually fun to play as (except 1) and the side content of this game is actually the best in the series. the 1 character that isn't fun is just lame and doesn't have very much depth to his style. saejima actually feels good to play as in this game. i'm not sure if they just changed how he felt or i did something wrong in 4 but he's cool now. akiyama and kiryu are akiyama and kiryu so they're obviously fun. hakura was vey unexpected. i mean its a rhythm game breaking up an action beat em up game  yet honestly it works pretty well. the side story minigames were pretty cool (especially kiryus) and a welcome addition although i didn't do them much because this game took me forever. i would've liked to do them more but i was growing impatient and just wanted to finish the game. the story in this game is just okay at best. 4 does the split paths crossing into one much better and all the different stories were just kind of tiring me out at that point. there were some really sweet heartfelt moments here and there but it wasn't enough to make me 100% invested like other games. the music also wasn't as strong as the last game which isn't a dig at this games music it's still good. just not as good. so while the story was a little too long and convoluted for my liking the gameplay was enough to keep me hooked on this series. another yakuza banger.""

Like many 1980s-era platformers the player can accumulate points with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However because Kirby lacks a save function scores are not recorded.

The publisher has emphasized how hard it's trying to get things right this time and for many it couldn't have chosen a better game.
             

              Jet Set Radio was part of Sega's onslaught of new properties with an emphasis on flash and style during the second wave of Dreamcast software but it might be one of the more obscure. It's a game that almost everyone has heard of but I think few have actually played. This was remedied somewhat with 2002's Xbox sequel Jet Set Radio Future. Unlike Sonic Adventure or the arcade hit Crazy Taxi Jet Set Radio HD is the chance for many to finally play a game they've only heard about.

'extraordinarily okay game misogyny is so back' '6 features goldeneye still gets right like almost no shooter and movie adaption today:' 'this game certainly has a legendary status for not only being a catalyst of console fps games but also for its phenomenal multiplayer where its just plain fun to blast away at your friends and scream at em for screenpeeking and picking oddjob. i had owned this game for years and not even touched the singleplayer mode so i finally got around to doing the actual campaign and its aight. the controls take some time to get used to for sure but once i got over the learning curve it was very smooth sailing. i think my main gripe with the game is just that i don\'t know how the game wanted me to play the whole time. since the game was initially designed to be a gallery shooter before the devs switched to an fps the levels are designed with a lot of ""choke points"" where there are a lot of enemies and one way to proceed. naturally especially considering this game is a james bond game the correct move would be to cautiously take out all the enemies before proceeding to the next area. unfortunately the game continues to spawn enemies infinitely if you decide to stay in one spot too long so sometimes a better play would be to throw caution to the wind and just run through everyone blasting them like its doom. due to the fact that it\'s hard to tell how the game wants you to play for each level plus the fact that each level is rather open and nonlinear allowing the player to get lost frequently it all blends together to create a rather unbalanced gameplay experience. the soundtrack is good and graphically the environments are very nice looking on the n64 with far draw distances for the system and not too much slowdown. once again the multiplayer is some of the most fun you can have on the n64. all in all great with friends eh by yourself.'

'taking pretty much everything the original game did expanding and refining it prime 2 is simply one of the best games in the entire metroid franchise. the dichotomy of the dark world allows the game to keep the backtracking elements prime 1 was infamous for but implement them in a way that is significantly less obtrusive and unintuitive. and while it takes a bit to get there it has some beautiful art direction with sanctuary fortress standing out as incredibly striking and beautiful and i’m willing to bet it would look even better with an hd remaster like the first game got. luckily this game also rectified of prime 1’s unfortunate flaws a lack of an ending escape timer and it does it in a great and memorable way having you face off against dark samus in one of the coolest confrontations in the series while on the clock to the entire dark aether dimension being destroyed. overall this is an undeniable classic that anyone who is interested in metroid should get around to playing.'

""super underrated but still flawed for sure. probably the best thing is the atmosphere this game makes. there's such an eerie claustrophobic feeling you get plunging deep into the caverns of an alien world hunting for metroids that are gradually becoming stronger and more horrifying as you progress. and the ending sequence is incredibly cinematic and terrifying for a game boy game from 1991. but the fact that most rooms look exactly the same so you get lost easily and the somewhat clunky controls make it a bit hard to recommend. but if you can push through all that this game is a great experience for any metroid fan"" ""metroid 2 is a fantastic game for the game boy. it's full of atmosphere eerie music hostile as fuck metroids and the kind of very satisfying progression i've grown used to with the previous metroid. the only problem i see with the game is the lack of a map system can make it frustrating to nevigate. but there's a reason why this game has a dozen fan remakes. it's a pretty stellar metroid game. definitely worth the little time it takes on nso.""

1210,street fighter ii,1991-02-01,'capcom' 'u.s. gold',3.5,433,433.0,'arcade' 'fighting',"A sequel to Street Fighter Street Fighter II improved upon the many concepts introduced in the first game including the use of command-based special moves and a six-button configuration while offering players a selection of multiple playable characters each with their own unique fighting style and special moves.
             

              Street Fighter II is credited for starting the fighting game boom during the 1990s. Its success led to the production of several updated versions each offering additional features and characters over previous versions as well as many home versions. Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom's best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008.
             

              Street Fighter II follows several of the conventions and rules already established by its original 1987 predecessor. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left a ""double KO"" or ""draw game"" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match.
             

              After every third match in the single player mode the player will participate in a ""bonus game"" for additional points. The bonus games includes (in order) a car-breaking event; a barrel breaking bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-breaking bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other. The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo.
             

              Like in the original the game's controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The player uses the joystick to jump crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent as well as to guard the character from an opponent's attacks. There are three punch buttons and three kick buttons of differing strength and speed (Light Medium and Heavy). The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position including grabbing/throwing attacks which were not featured in the original Street Fighter. Like in the original the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands.
             

              Street Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves. Additionally the player can also ""cancel"" during animation by performing another move allowing for a combination of several basic and special moves. Both of these features would be expanded upon in subsequent installments.","'the fighting game that redefined all fighting games. it created a whole new scene and entirely rejuvenated an entire industry. a cultural phenomenon.'

1273,metal gear,1987-07-13,'ultra games' 'konami',2.9,344,344.0,'adventure' 'shooter',"Metal Gear is considered to be the progenitor of the stealth game genre it was also the first video game designed by Hideo Kojima who also directed many of the later Metal Gear sequels. A heavily altered port was produced for the Famicom/NES (without Kojima's involvement). A remade version based on the original MSX2 game was released as a bonus game in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2 and as a result is also included in Metal Gear Solid HD Collection and Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection.
             

              The game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake who goes into a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy Metal Gear a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world.
             

              The player must navigate the main character a military operative codenamed Solid Snake through various locations while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards. If the player is seen the game enters the ""Alert Mode."" In this situation Snake must escape from enemy's sight in order to resume infiltration. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery:
             

              If Snake is seen and only a single exclamation mark appears over an enemy's head only the enemies in the player's present screen will attack and Snake can escape by simply moving to an adjacent screen.
              
              However if two exclamation marks appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera infrared sensor or by using an unsuppressed weapon) reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. Snake can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies going outdoors or by entering an elevator.
              
              The player starts the game unarmed but eventually acquires firearms such as a Beretta 92F and an M79 grenade launcher as well as explosives such as remote control missiles and landmines. Ammo and supplies for weapons are limited but are replenished by picking up ammunition caches or additional supplies. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies but also to clear obstacles such as hollow walls and electrified floors. Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up. In addition to enemy guards the player will also be confronted by mercenaries who will challenge the player to combat serving as the boss characters.
             

              The enemy base consists of three different buildings with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors and explore new areas. Each door will only open to its corresponding key cards. Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages the player's rank will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars) allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However if a hostage is killed the player is demoted to the previous rank.
             

              A transceiver is available for the player to communicate with their commanding officer Big Boss or one of the resistance members operating covertly near Outer Heaven (Schneider Diane and Jennifer). Each of Snake's allies specializes in a specific subject. The player must keep track of their allies' frequency numbers in order to contact them. All of the radio messages are dependent on the rooms where the player is located.","""this would've been better if lupin iii was there"" 'absolutely incredible game with elements i never could imagine being implemented in 1987. truthfully save states are why i was able to fully enjoy the game as the amount of deaths and where it sends you back definitely gets very tedious and can completely ruin the experience.'

The player can move along platforms as well as jump to those above and to the side similar to most platform games.
             

              The player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected around the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000 2000 and 4000 points and so on) which results in earning lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting and can be jumped on allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.
             

              Enemies turn ""angry"" — becoming pink-colored and moving faster — if they are the last enemy remaining escape from a bubble after being left too long or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game) and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen (however this is a rare occurrence).

Mario and friends are invited to the Baseball Kingdom to play games against each other. When Bowser hears this he immediately interrupts the party.
             

              There are several game modes to choose from like in the previous game. In Exhibition mode players play a single game against each other. Players can choose different options such as how many innings to play if captains can use star powers (each captain has a different star swing and pitch) and toggle error items off and on (error items can be thrown at fielders).
             

              The single-player Challenge mode is different this time around. Instead of choosing a team captain players start with Mario who must find teammates to take on Bowser Jr. and Bowser. Teammates aren't unlocked by playing a game rather they only join the team by clearing certain objectives. Most of the action takes place on areas with an overhead perspective; each area is based around a team captain. Each captain has a special ability to find teammates and coins which are used to buy items to aid in the quest or in a game against Bowser Jr. or later against Bowser. More coins can be gotten in minigames.
             

              Toy Field mode is slightly different to the one featured in Mario Superstar Baseball. Like in the GameCube game players take turns batting to get points; a turn is granted to whomever grabs and holds the ball after a certain amount of time has passed. Unlike in the previous game however fielders can attack each other to steal the ball away from whomever has it. The batter can also throw items at the fielders to cause them to drop the ball and grant the batter another turn.","'make another mario baseball game' 'its baseball but with all of the standard mario fun packed in. i never played the original so i wouldnt know if its better or worse but this game is good not amazing but good.'

1434,nba jam,1993-06-02,'midway',3.6,106,106.0,'sport',"NBA Jam is a basketball arcade game published and developed by Midway in 1993. It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series. The main designer and programmer for this game was Mark Turmell. Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989 High Impact in 1990 and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.
              
              The game became exceptionally popular and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994 the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.
              
              The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz) and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).","""the console ports of this game don't suffer from the coin-munching syndrome that is plagueing the arcade. fun to play especially against another human otherwise the ai cheats way too much to make it fun for long.""

(no joking; i played through this game twice several years apart and i literally dozed off during the mermaid shmup part both times.) truly this series just needed a chance to get a new real release that would let it stretch its psuedo-metroidvania wings and be an amazing game!\n                     \n                     well we more-or-less got that with pirate\'s curse. while the metroidvania aspects were still very simplistic - the world was broken up into several islands most of which had extremely linear maps - the new pirate abilities were much more fun and easy to use than the old transformations so it was still fun to backtrack through the islands to find hidden items. (the series is closer to a sidescrolling zelda now that i think about it since there are the dungeons that are separate from the overworld and don\'t require a revisit unless you happen to miss something.) at the time i (among others) thought that they still needed to make the next step towards a ""proper"" metroidvania and they\'d truly have something.\n                     \n                     then there was half-genie hero. first off it was weird that they began the kickstarter for this game\n                     \n                      after\n                     \n                     pirate\'s curse had been announced but\n                     \n                      before\n                     \n                     it actually released. we had only played the original game and risky\'s revenge at this point and had the promise of pirate\'s curse releasing within a year or two. additionally the as-yet-unreleased pirate\'s curse had the best character art in the series (thanks to inticreates aiding with parts of the game) as well as the best pixel art hgh went with more of a chibi-styled smooth style. still more shantae was more shantae and it felt like the series was finally getting its due (even if the fans had to pay for some of the development). ultimately though the game was closer to a mega man x entry than the earlier games\' metroidvania/sidescrolling zelda style. there was no overworld with dungeons but instead several independent platforming stages that you would select from a list. as with the mmx games you could return to completed stages with new abilities to find more powerups. unlike the mmx games though in which you get both permanent upgrades (helmet boots etc.) and special weapons you can easily swap between shantae has to stop and do a transformation dance in order to use her new abilities. it leads to a slower less fun platforming experience and i was ultimately disappointed in the game.\n                     \n                     finally this leads us to seven sirens. we finally got what we wanted in a monkey\'s paw sort of way. there\'s a full interconnected metroidvania map now! ...but there are also the zelda-like dungeons that are independent of each other and the overworld. while some of these have been fun in earlier games the dungeons i played in ss are very simple and straightforward. i\'d rather have just the connected map with more interesting platforming and puzzles. additionally early on you get an ability that reveals secrets ranging from gems (money) to hidden platforms. the unfortunate part is that you get a visual notification on every screen in which there is something hidden which is basically almost every screen requiring you to stop and use the ability to try and find whatever it is. most of the time it\'s nothing special and this power also uses mana (or whatever) so you need to fill it up after using it several times.\n                     \n                     all that to say that the series has come close to greatness but never quite reaches it and the best entry is now lost in the middle of a bunch of mediocre-at-best games.' ""i debate back and forth whether or not i like this or pirate's curse more. i like the change to one single open metroidvania world when compared to the separate segmented ones of the past. the way transformations work is probably the best in the series with how seamless and fluid they are but the dances feel a bit lame. there's so many different rooms where you can use them and most of the time there's nothing more than gems that you get out of them.\n                     \n                     i found the gameplay balancing to be a a bit out of wack as well. i played on the definitive mode that the game recommends and found the game much much harder at the beginning. you are starved for healing items and resources which made the beginning parts a lot more challenging than anything later. but by about 33% through the game i had more than enough money to keep myself capped on all of the healing items.\n                     \n                     the progression feels a bit too formulaic as well with the game constantly switching between having you find x amount of mcguffins and then doing a dungeon and then repeating till the end. that said i enjoyed the game overall. the world is fun to explore the powers are interesting and the music is great."" ""mixing the pirate's curse and half-genue forbids this game makes for a fun time. while not as fluid as other titles the focus is in the metroidvania aspect this time. an enjoyable game with an alright story.""

""thank goodness we have another metroidvania-style shantae game and this time it's the classic kind. in terms of presentations this is easily the best in the saga the overworld graphics and the portraits be looking pretty cute and although the music may be the weakest in the saga it has some catchy tunes. as for gameplay they finally fixed the transformations problem even if they're still not as good as the pirate gear in pirate's curse it's a step in the right direction. the game is great and a lot of fun but it has some problems. the bosses are pretty bad most of them consisting of dodging a sequence of three attacks and then hitting them for a while rinse and repeat although a couple of them are admittedly fun. the animated sequences look pretty rough too but it's a noble concept that i hope to see expanded in later games. finally good god trying to beat this game with 100% completion is a freaking chore as most of the items you need are hidden or in a location that hasn't been relevant in a while and there being no markers on the map to remember where they are is a missed opportunity. either way it's a pretty good game the second best in the series so if you liked pirate's curse but were not a fan of half genie hero i'd say play this to see how you like it.""

too bad you\'ve put all of your points into the hammer. it is true that you can respec later on but this kind of game would have benefitted from a skyrim-style system where you level up weapons ability based on using the weapon.\n                     \n                     the story is your usual high-fantasy bafflegarble; it\'s not great but i\'m usually fairly lenient on bad stories as long as they aren\'t shoved in your face by ""cinematic"" cutscenes. the dialogue choices tend to be pointless and apparently you can use persuasion skills to steamroll past everything. i highly dislike dialogue choices in games where they do not make a difference or make very little difference; developers and writers need to have confidence in the story that they are telling.\n                     \n                     the ""open world"" is a series of poorly-disguised corridors with the occasional boring dungeon. the game feels less open than an n64 zelda and even the map clearly shows the corridors. thus there\'s no real exploration in the game; not that there is any real point to the exploration anyway. i found nothing about the enemy designs world or other art to be at all interesting. the semi-cartoony art style clashed with the occasional graphic violence of the game. every npc has a thousand dialogue keywords that you can choose from and none of them are interesting.  the loot system was not engaging or addicting; there was no way to easily compare stats for new items vs equipped items and given the fact that combat felt like a chore i didn\'t really feel excited to upgrade my gear. i am barely interested in smithing crafting alchemy etc. in most games and in any case skyrim did all of these better than amalur.\n                     \n                     everything about this game just felt like busywork. i could probably forgive one or more mediocre elements of this game if they combined to create an immersive and interesting whole but amalur just feels like fantasy game: the game. everything in the game feels very much like a video game element. i don\'t know if this makes sense but it describes the sense i felt while playing it. it was the opposite of skyrim a game that while it contains clunky and repetitive elements really feels like living in a fantasy world. amalur feels like playing a fantasy game (quite appropriately since it was originally intended to be an mmo) and nothing about it grabbed me. in my earlier years i may have been able to ignore its many flaws but at this point in my life with so much experience gaming and so many superior choices available i can\'t justify playing this game.' ""'na verga"" ""'tis a beauty of a game. i was really satisfied with this especially considering it came out only a few months after the extremely grey/brown skyrim. it's basically just skyrim with a much more interesting world and a much deeper combat system. it honestly felt kind of similar to the original god of war games in that way."" ""for a game that got overshadowed by bigger titles its incredibly underrated and deserves more recognition. its a beautiful looking game with so much to explore and do i loved it for the first 3/4 of the game. however...when it gets towards the end you find its very half assed there's a few bugs here and there and it just felt very incomplete. but most of the game is great and there is so much character creation it's ridiculous dlc's were interesting and beautiful looking pieces two.""

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360 PlayStation 2 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title Guitar Hero World Tour Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience including lead and bass guitar drums and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features such as drop-in/drop-out play bands composed of any combination of available instruments a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars clothing and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.
             

              Guitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists and like previous Guitar Hero games several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game including Johnny Cash Carlos Santana Shirley Manson Matthew Bellamy and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5 along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock and spin-off game Band Hero.
             

              The game was well received by reviewers who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well however it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However the game's track list was considered to be too broad and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.","""it's a game. it's guitar hero. if you like guitar hero you are gonna like this. the setlist is relatively diverse albiet maybe a bit more leaning towards pop music over metal and rock. i heard beforehand that this game was the straw that apparently broke the camels back and made guitar hero more leaning to casuals and i can kind of see that but also not really? most of the setlist was very easy but the last few songs are still good fun. this game also has a completely revamped graphics engine which looks very good in action so that's neat. there are also bonus challenges for certain songs that are actually really difficult so gh maniacs still have fun things to do i feel. overall it's more guitar hero. you can't go wrong with guitar hero though i can see why constant releases of just more guitar hero would definitely fatigue the audience into the franchises decline.""

'it looks pretty ig' ""feels great to play but the lack of budget kills all of its goodwill. it's fun having a game where the (mostly) full sonic cast is interacting again but there's no meat on this plot's bone - even less so in the campaign's actual missions and pacing.""",1500.0,49.0,413.0,107.0

""a thriving story with well-written companions close-to-perfect d&d mechanics better combat system than divinity 2: original sin. as for the graphics the characters look very realistic facial capture artists are really beautiful. before you play the game i suggest that you should read descent into avernus. my last words are i can't wait to play act 2-3."" 'friends are required to enjoy this game.' ""game can be fun but the story character interactions and the characters themselves all fucking suck. it's early access so i won't hate on glitches but god damn do the characters reek doodoo! lae'zel is one dimension and lame shadowheart is fucking boring and again one dimensional gael is like someone wrote their own op ass dnd character into the game at level 1 with the excuse being they lost their power. astarion is funny as fuck but is also just one dimensional. if you wanna be good then don't have him in your party because he will not like anything you do. will is the only party member that i even remotely like. he is at least a nice guy with an okay backstory. game is also terribly optimized for storage.""",269.0,79.0,388.0,602.0
